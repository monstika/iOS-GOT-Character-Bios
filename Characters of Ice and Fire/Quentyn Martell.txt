Ser Quentyn Martell is the second child and oldest son of Doran Martell.[3] He serves as the third-person narrator for four chapters in A Dance with Dragons. He is described as intelligent, serious, and dutiful, [86] though not particularly handsome. Throughout A Feast for Crows, his sister Arianne believes that he is conspiring to claim Dorne, her birthright, and knows that he is in Essos. Their father, Prince Doran lies and constantly insists that Quentyn is still in Dorne. Eventually, Prince Doran reveals that Quentyn is going to bring home justice for Elia Martell, Aegon Targaryen, and Oberyn Martell.
