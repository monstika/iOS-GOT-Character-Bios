Lyanna Stark was Eddard Stark's younger and only sister, and the betrothed of Robert Baratheon, who adored her, though it is mentioned that Lyanna was not quite so enthusiastic about the betrothal. She was known for being headstrong, spirited, and beautiful; Eddard's daughter Arya Stark is often compared to Lyanna for their similar personality and appearance. The novels present Lyanna as a trigger for Robert's Rebellion fifteen years before the series; however, the characters remember details differently. According to Daenerys Targaryen, Prince Rhaegar Targaryen crowned Lyanna Stark as his queen of love and beauty at a tournament, passing over his wife Elia Martell, and he "later stole [Lyanna] away from her betrothed". Rhaegar had kidnapped Lyanna with the help of Arthur Dayne and Oswell Whent. Barristan Selmy and Daenerys believe Rhaegar was in love with Lyanna. When House Stark protested Lyanna's kidnapping, King Aerys II Targaryen horrifically executed Lyanna's father and brother Brandon. A civil war named Robert's Rebellion ensued that eventually ended at the Trident where Robert killed Rhaegar,[7] who according to Daenerys died for the woman he loved. Shortly afterwards, Eddard went to rescue Lyanna from the Tower of Joy in Dorne. He found her dying "in a bed of blood" and her last words were "Promise me, Ned." She was buried in the crypts of Winterfell, though the crypts are usually reserved for the Kings and Lords of Winterfell.
