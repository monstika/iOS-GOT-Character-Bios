Jojen Reed is a member of House Reed. Thirteen years old,[1] he is Lord Howland Reed's only son and Meera Reed's younger brother. Jojen has greensight, the power of prophetic green dreams. In the HBO adaptation Game of Thrones he is portrayed by Thomas Brodie-Sangster.

Jojen is the son of Stark bannerman Howland Reed, Lord of Greywater Watch and leader of the crannogmen of the Neck. Howland Reed is commonly regarded as one of Ned Stark's closest friends, despite having not left Greywater Watch since the war. They first appear in A Clash of Kings, where they are sent to renew House Reed's pledge to the Starks in place of their father and are asked to befriend and support the late Eddard Stark's children. 

Jojen is described as having unusually green eyes and is always wearing green. When he nearly died of greyscale fever, he was visited by a three-eyed crow and gifted with the greensight, prophetic but abstract dreams. While in Winterfell, Jojen recognizes that Bran Stark is a skinchanger, someone able to enter the mind of an animal and control its actions, and helps him gain control over his ability. When he learns about Bran's vision of the three-eyed crow, he urges Bran to look for it north of the Wall. When Theon Greyjoy takes control of Winterfell, Jojen and Meera hide in the crypts under the castle before they flee north with Bran. At the end of A Storm of Swords, they travel beyond the Wall and Jojen becomes very weak on the journey. In A Dance with Dragons, Jojen falls into a depression and wants to return to Greywater Watch. Meera struggles to keep the group's spirits up, but implies that Jojen has had a greendream about his fate when he reaches home and his future is bleak.
