Mance Rayder was a wildling child who was raised by the Night's Watch and later joined their ranks. However, he broke his vows and abandoned his post. Since then, he gained influence among the wildlings and has become known as "King-beyond-the-Wall." In A Storm of Swords, he unites all the wildlings under his command and leads them to attack the Wall from the south.
