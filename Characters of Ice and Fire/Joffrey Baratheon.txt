Joffrey is the eldest of Queen Cersei Lannister's children and Robert's heir to the Iron Throne. Though a Baratheon in name, Joffrey is actually a product of incest between Cersei and Jaime Lannister. Joffrey is unaware of his true parentage until he hears it through rumours around King's Landing. Robert Baratheon never questions Joffrey's lineage though is not fond of the youth and often ignores him. He is described as a strong-willed child with a vicious temper and an unchecked sadistic streak, a behavior often attributed to Cersei's and Robert's parenting. He takes as his personal coat of arms the Baratheon black-and-gold crowned stag and the Lannister red-and-gold lion combatant.

During the events of A Game of Thrones, Joffrey is betrothed to Sansa Stark. However, it is revealed in A Storm of Swords that Joffrey sent an assassin to kill the crippled Bran Stark on a whim; it is later further revealed that he did so to try to impress his father after overhearing a drunken Robert say that Bran should be put out of his misery. After Robert's death, Joffrey is crowned king, then arrests Eddard Stark for refusing to acknowledge his right. Though he forces Ned to recant and declare him king in order to save his daughters, Joffrey takes back his promise to Sansa to exile her father and instead orders Ned's execution, which touches off the conflict that follows, and leads to the War of the Five Kings. Throughout A Clash of Kings, his reign marks by the start of the War of the Five Kings, Joffrey rules King's Landing with cruelty and caprice, often ignoring his mother and advisors.
