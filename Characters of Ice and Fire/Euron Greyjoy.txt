Euron Greyjoy is the younger brother of Balon and captain of a ship which is entirely crewed by men whose tongues Euron ripped out. He is described as an unpredictable man who plays vicious mind games. Because of this, he is hated by all his brothers. He wears a patch over his left eye, for which he is nicknamed Crow's Eye. Before the events of the series, he was banished from the Iron Islands and was warned to never return while Balon lives. During his exile, he sailed throughout the world, raping and plundering, and became extremely wealthy. In A Feast for Crows, Euron returns to the islands the day after Balon's death though he is supposed to be months away. Because of his timely return, many characters believe he played a part in Balon's death. To decide the next king of the Iron Islands, a Kingsmoot is called, and Euron is chosen as king. He begins wildly successful raids along the Reach and weakens possible rivals by giving land and titles to their key supporters. However, he fails to move past raiding. He sends his brother Victarion to court Daenerys Targaryen in his name and bring her and her dragons to Westeros.
