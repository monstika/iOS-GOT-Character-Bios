Melisandre of Asshai is a priestess of R'hllor in service to Stannis Baratheon. She is introduced in A Clash of Kings and serves as the third-person narrator for one chapter of A Dance with Dragons. She is described as a beautiful woman with red eyes, and like all the clergy of her faith, she is always dressed in red; vague recollections of her own past imply that Melisandre was once a slave called Melony, and that she was sold to the temple of R'hllor when she was a child. Because of her devotion to R'hllor, she possesses magical abilities, has prophetic visions, and does not need to eat or sleep. A great heat emanates from her body. She is often friendly, though many characters feel intimidated or threatened by her presence. Melisandre takes a militant stance against the other religions of Westeros, believing the other gods to be demons who need to be destroyed. By A Clash of Kings, Melisandre has converted Stannis's wife Queen Selyse into a follower of R'hllor and has convinced Stannis that he is the Azor Ahai, the messianic figure prophesied to return and end the perpetual war between R'hllor and his opponent, the Great Other. She becomes his most trusted adviser and counsels him on how to prepare for the battle against the enemy Great Other. She is also able to win over many of Stannis's men, but alienates the rest because of her aggressive counsel, her attitude toward their religion, and her strange faith and abilities. Many, most notably Stannis's trusted adviser Davos Seaworth, believe she is leading their king astray. Attempts on her life are made at least twice, once by Dragonstone's aged Maester Cressen after Stannis's coronation, and once by Davos following the Battle of the Blackwater; her powers allow her to survive one and foresee the other. Despite the fact that Davos planned to kill her, she trusts him as he is steadfast in his loyalty to Stannis. She takes credit for the deaths of Stannis's enemies and competitors for the throne, killing Renly Baratheon and Ser Cortnay Penrose, castellan at Storm's End, with shadow assassins conjured from her womb (although Renly's death is portrayed without her part, it is implied when she births the shadow which kills Ser Cortnay).
