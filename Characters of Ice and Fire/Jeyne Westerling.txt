Jeyne Westerling is the daughter of Lord Gawen and Lady Sybell Westerling, a family sworn to House Lannister. In "A Clash of Kings", she meets rebel Robb Stark when he captures her father's castle. He is wounded in the fighting, and Jeyne nurses him back to health. While at the castle, he receives word that Theon Greyjoy has captured Winterfell and killed his brothers. She comforts him in his grief and has sex with him. Robb marries her the next day in an attempt to preserve her honor and breaks a marriage contract with House Frey. The couple spend much time and effort to conceive an heir but to no apparent result; she again tries to comfort Robb after he executes Rickard Karstark for treason. After Robb's departure for the Twins Jeyne remains in Riverrun and subsequently does not witness her husband's murder. After the Red Wedding, she is granted a royal pardon. In A Feast for Crows, she is openly mourning and defies her mother. House Lannister promises Sybell that Jeyne will be married to a lord or an heir, but she must remain unmarried for two years to prevent rumors that her children are also Robb's. Sybell insists that Jeyne unwittingly drank potions that prevented her from conceiving. She last appears riding to Casterly Rock under heavy guard. In 2011, it was announced that Oona Chaplin would play Jeyne in the HBO adaptation of the novels.[S 14] However, when the series was released, Jeyne's character had been replaced by Talisa Maegyr (played by Chaplin), a healer from Volantis, whose story, apart from her marriage to Robb, was completely different.
