Doran Martell is the Prince of Dorne and the Lord of Sunspear. He is the father of Arianne, Quentyn, and Trystane. By A Game of Thrones, he is in his fifties; and his gout leaves him barely able to walk and dependent on a wheeled chair. He spends most of his time at the Water Gardens, the Martells' summer home, watching children play. To hide his weakness from his enemies, he avoids the common people and holds audiences only with trusted courtiers and advisers. Unlike the other Martells and the general population of Dorne, he is a cautious, pensive man who does not display his emotions. Because of this, his family sees him as weak; but the other lords of Westeros consider him dangerous. In A Clash of Kings, he refuses to swear allegiance to King Joffrey Baratheon and considers supporting the rebel Renly Baratheon. He swears loyalty to Joffrey after Tyrion Lannister sends Myrcella Baratheon to Dorne and engages her to Trystane; offers justice for his murdered sister Elia; and gives him a position on Joffrey's council. In A Storm of Swords, Doran sends his brother Oberyn to claim the justice and the position. After Oberyn's death, Doran refuses to start a war and returns to Sunspear in A Feast for Crows to show the people he still holds the power. He imprisons Oberyn's warlike daughters, called the Sand Snakes, to maintain peace. After foiling his daughter Arianne's attempt to crown Myrcella the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, he reveals that he has long been planning the downfall of Tywin Lannister to avenge Elia and intends to ally with House Targaryen. In A Dance with Dragons, he is again offered a seat on the King's council; and Trystane is invited to King's Landing. However, Doran knows that this is a ploy to ambush the pair on the journey and kill Trystane. Instead, he sends one of Oberyn's daughters to take the position. Later, he hears a fleet of ships is sailing to Westeros and prepares the armies of Dorne to strike.
