Janos Slynt was a former Commander of the City Watch in King's Landing and eventually a brother in the Night's Watch. He has three children, two sons and a daughter, and is described as being 'frog-faced' and 'built like a keg'. He first appears in A Game of Thrones, initially to request Lord Eddard Stark's assistance in recruiting more men to police the crowds coming to King's Landing for the Tourney of the Hand. Later, when Eddard intends to depose Joffrey due to his illegitimate status and attempts to wrest control of the crown from Queen Cersei, Littlefinger assures him the loyalty of the City Watch by promising to pay off Slynt and the Watch's officers. However, Ned learns too late that Slynt and Littlefinger's real allegiance lies with the Lannisters; the City Watchmen present in the throne room assist the Lannister soldiers present in massacring the Stark men-at-arms and arresting Eddard. For his assistance, Janos Slynt is raised to the small council, made a lord and given Harrenhal for his seat; this decision outrages many amongst the nobility, including Tywin Lannister, given that Slynt was a lowborn commoner and Harrenhal an ancient and significantly important castle.

In A Clash of Kings, one of Tyrion Lannister's first actions as acting Hand of the King is to dismiss Slynt to the Night's Watch, as Tyrion distrusts Slynt's propensity for corruption and treacherous nature, his father specified that the lowborn Slynt be removed from the small council and lordship of Harrenhal, and Tyrion is disgusted by his willingness to murder an infant girl on Cersei's orders (the girl was murdered because she was a bastard of Robert's, and could be used as a claimant to the throne against Joffrey). Slynt and a number of his chief cronies in the City Watch are exiled to the Wall by Tyrion and his position as Commander given to Ser Jacelyn Bywater, a knight loyal to Tyrion (though Tyrion believes that in getting rid of Slynt for Bywater, he has merely replaced a man loyal to Littlefinger with one loyal to Varys and is still angered that Cersei, the one behind Slynt, remains untouchable).
