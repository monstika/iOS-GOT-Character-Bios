Lady Catelyn Stark, formerly of House Tully, was the wife of Lord Eddard Stark (Ned); mother to Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Rickon Stark; daughter of Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun and sister to Lysa Arryn of the Vale. She is a POV character for twenty-five chapters throughout A Game of Thrones, A Clash of Kings, and A Storm of Swords. Catelyn is proud, strong, kind, and generous. She is seen as honourable and upright by acquaintances, holding duty over desire as a governing principle of behaviour. Catelyn also has a strong grasp of politics and possesses considerable insight into what makes Westeros run. Nevertheless, Catelyn is also a fiercely protective woman and more often than not follows her heart rather than her head, especially when it comes to her family, whom she loves deeply.

Catelyn describes her childhood as a happy one, where she was close to her sister, Lysa, and her father Hoster, a kind and just ruler of his domain in the Seven Kingdoms. Upon her twelfth birthday she was betrothed to Brandon Stark, the heir presumptive of Winterfell. However, despite her betrothal, her childhood friend Petyr Baelish was very attracted to Catelyn and except for Catelyn's intervention, might have been killed in a duel with Brandon. When Brandon's sister Lyanna was apparently kidnapped by Crown Prince Rhaegar, Brandon was murdered alongside his father at King's Landing by Aerys II. Catelyn married Brandon's brother, Eddard, in Brandon's stead in a double wedding ceremony at Riverun where her sister married Lord Jon Arryn. Catelyn became pregnant on her wedding night and birthed Robb while Ned was fighting in Robert's Rebellion. Ned returned a year later with his illegitimate child Jon Snow. Catelyn always resented Snow, and did not interact with him as a mother or step-mother figure.
