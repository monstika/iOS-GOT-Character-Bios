Ser Davos Seaworth, called the Onion Knight and sometimes Shorthand, is the common-born head of the newly founded House Seaworth and was formerly known as the most notorious and most elusive smuggler in the Seven Kingdoms. He is introduced in A Clash of Kings and is the third-person narrator for a total of thirteen chapters throughout A Clash of Kings, A Storm of Swords, and A Dance with Dragons. In his smuggling days, he was said to handle a ship at night better than anyone. Before the events of the series, he earned his knighthood by smuggling fish and onions to the besieged Stannis Baratheon and his army during Robert Baratheon's rebellion. Before knighting him, Stannis removed the last joints from four fingers on Davos's left hand as punishment for years of smuggling; believing these joints bought his wife and seven sons a better future, Davos keeps them in a pouch around his neck for luck until they are lost in the Battle of the Blackwater. In A Clash of Kings, he loyally supports Stannis's claim to the throne and his honesty and willingness to voice his unaltered opinion make him Stannis's most trusted adviser, though Stannis often dislikes what he hears. However, Davos is a follower of the Faith of the Seven and cannot bring himself to accept or trust the priestess Melisandre and her god R'hllor. He does not object to her because Stannis is also a follower of R'hllor. He fights in the Battle of the Blackwater, an attack on King's Landing that ends in the slaughter of Stannis's troops; Davos's four eldest sons are killed and Davos himself seemingly perishes. In A Storm of Swords, he is revealed to have barely survived.[68] He blames Melisandre for the deaths of his sons and plans to kill her, but she foresees the attempt and has him jailed. Stannis pardons Davos and raises him to Lord of the Rainwood and names him Hand of the King, a position Davos reluctantly accepts. Feeling that a Hand cannot be illiterate, he learns to read and write and inadvertently reads the Night's Watch's letter calling for aid. Davos convinces Stannis to help the Watch defend against the wildling army. While Stannis sails to the Wall, Davos goes to White Harbor in the North to negotiate an alliance with Lord Manderly, who takes him captive. In A Feast for Crows, Manderly is ordered to execute Davos in exchange for Manderly's son. Soon after, Davos's head and hands are said to be displayed on the city walls. A Dance with Dragons reveals that Manderly executed a similar-looking criminal instead. Davos is secretly and comfortably held in a cell and is released upon the return of Manderly's son. Manderly will pledge White Harbor's support, and promises most of the North will follow suit, if Davos uses his smuggling skills to recover Manderly's liege lord Rickon Stark, who was previously thought dead. Upon learning the boy's whereabouts, implied to be the northern island of Skagos, Davos considers returning to his cell better than sailing through dangerous waters to where cannibals live. Davos Seaworth is played by Liam Cunningham in the television adaptation of the novels. Because Cunningham is left-handed, the writers decided to shorten the fingers on the character's right hand instead of his left.
