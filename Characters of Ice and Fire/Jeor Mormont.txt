Jeor Mormont, called the Old Bear, is the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch. He was the Lord of Bear Island in the North, but he joined the Watch to pass the title to his son Jorah Mormont. He is considered a strong, resolute leader and commands a great deal of respect. He keeps a large raven capable of speaking simple phrases as a pet. In A Game of Thrones, he chooses Jon Snow as his personal steward, intending to groom him for command. Soon after, a wight, a dead body reanimated by the Others, attempts to kill him, but Jon kills the wight. As thanks, he gives Jon the Mormont ancestral sword, Longclaw, although the hilt is changed from a bear head to a wolf head to reflect Jon's Stark heritage.[98] To investigate the return of wights, the disappearance of several Rangers, and rumors of a wildling army, Jeor leads an expeditionary force beyond the Wall in A Clash of Kings. His force is assaulted by Others and an army of wights in A Storm of Swords, and he leads the survivors to a wildling keep. There, the men mutiny and kill him. As he dies, he tells Samwell Tarly to ask Jorah to join the Watch and asks Samwell to forgive Jorah in his place.

Jeor Mormont is portrayed by James Cosmo in the HBO adaptation of the novels.
