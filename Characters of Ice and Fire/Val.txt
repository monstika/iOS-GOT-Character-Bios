Val is the sister of Mance Rayder's wife, Dalla. After the failed Wildling incursion, she is kept prisoner at the wall. Stannis and his men refer to her as the "wildling princess," and there is talk of having her make a political marriage, despite Jon's attempts to explain that Wildlings do not have the same hereditary nobility customs as other inhabitants of Westeros. She is described as exceptionally attractive by Jon. In A Dance with Dragons, Jon Snow sends her alone on a mission to bring a Wildling warlord named Tormund Giantsbane and his people to the Wall. She rides alone into the wilderness and returns weeks later with Tormund, the mission successful.

The Royal Court at King's Landings is mostly composed of the King's small Council and his Kingsguard, the seven knights sworn to protect the king and his family. The small council is made up several officers: Hand of the King, the top adviser; Lord Commander of the Kingsguard; Master of Coin, the treasurer; Master of Laws, the law enforcer; Master of Whisperers, the spymaster; Master of Ships, the naval commander; and Grand Maester, the senior member of the maesters, an order of scholars and healers. All members of the small council, except for the Grand Maester, are appointed and dismissed by the king. The Grand Maester is appointed by the governing body of the maesters. The council is headed by the king, and only he can make the council's decisions law. The role falls to the regent if the king is too young or to the Hand if the king is absent.
