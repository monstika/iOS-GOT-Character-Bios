Rhaegar Targaryen was the oldest son of Aerys II, the Prince of Dragonstone, and the heir apparent to the Iron Throne of the Seven Kingdoms. He is described as an intelligent, brooding man who was initially very bookish. It was in one of those mysterious books that he found something that seemed to force him to reconsider his path. Thereafter he trained to become a skilled fighter but remained heavily introverted. He married Elia Martell and had two children, a girl named Rhaenys and an infant son named Aegon Targaryen. After winning a tourney, he crowned Lyanna Stark Queen of Love and Beauty, passing over Elia. He and Lyanna later disappeared, which House Stark and Lyanna's betrothed Robert Baratheon saw as Lyanna's abduction. There is a lot of controversy over what happened, as though many reports indicate it was an abduction, it is uncertain whether Lyanna Stark voluntarily ran away with him. Seeing Rhaegar through the eyes of Jon Connington and Barristan Selmy provides a different light to the hatred Robert Baratheon (and to a certain degree Eddard Stark) hold for him. Robert started a rebellion to rescue her. This eventually led to a battle on the river Trident, ending in the death of Rhaegar who was killed by a blow from Robert's hammer. Elia and Rhaenys were killed at King's Landing and along with the supposed death of his son Aegon. Though Robert vilifies Rhaegar throughout A Game of Thrones, many characters express admiration for him and it is stated that most of Westeros remembers him with love. It is also regularly implied that he would have been a great king. He was the namesake of Daenerys's late son, Rhaego, and of her green-colored dragon Rhaegal.
