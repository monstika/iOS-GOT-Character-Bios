Podrick Payne, Pod for short, is a distant cousin of Ser Ilyn Payne and becomes the squire to Tyrion Lannister toward the end of A Game of Thrones.[53] He is a very shy and nervous boy and is always stuttering, but he is a loyal and capable squire. In A Clash of Kings, he rides by Tyrion's side at the Battle of the Blackwater, during which he rescues Tyrion from an assassination attempt made by Ser Mandon Moore, a knight of the Kingsguard.
