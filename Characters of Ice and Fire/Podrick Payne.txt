Podrick Payne, Pod for short, is a distant cousin of Ser Ilyn Payne and becomes the squire to Tyrion Lannister toward the end of A Game of Thrones.[53] He is a very shy and nervous boy and is always stuttering, but he is a loyal and capable squire. In A Clash of Kings, he rides by Tyrion's side at the Battle of the Blackwater, during which he rescues Tyrion from an assassination attempt made by Ser Mandon Moore, a knight of the Kingsguard.[57] He continues his duties through A Storm of Swords until Tyrion vanishes in A Feast for Crows.[58][59] He then secretly follows Brienne of Tarth, knowing that she was looking for Tyrion's wife Sansa Stark. When he is discovered, Podrick admits that he is upset Tyrion abandoned him and hopes that Sansa will lead him to Tyrion.[60] He becomes Brienne's squire and serves her as faithfully as he did Tyrion.[61][62] He and Brienne are captured by outlaws known as the Brotherhood Without Banners, and the leader Lady Stoneheart orders Podrick to be hanged for serving Tyrion as squire. In his last appearance, he quietly accepts his fate and is being hanged alongside Brienne, who later appears alive.[56][63] His ultimate fate is unknown. Podrick Payne is played by Daniel Portman in the HBO adaptation of the novels.[S 20][64]
