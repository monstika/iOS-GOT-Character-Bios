Robert Arryn, sometimes called Sweetrobin, is the only child of Jon Arryn and Lysa Tully.[3] He is a sickly, whiny child who suffers from frequent seizure-like episodes called a shaking illness. He is depicted as being intellectually and physically stunted. Although he is six, his mother continues to breastfeed him.[48] At the start of the series, he is Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale and his mother rules as regent in his name.[3] After Lysa's marriage to Petyr Baelish and her subsequent death in a Storm of Swords, Baelish assumes the title Lord Protector of the Vale and claims the rule of the Vale and guardianship of Robert. Robert becomes increasingly emotional and unstable throughout A Feast for Crows and his shaking episodes become more frequent. In the absence of his mother, he becomes highly attached to his cousin Sansa Stark in her disguise of Alayne Stone.[49] In the television adaptation of the novels, the character is renamed Robin Arryn to prevent confusion with Robert Baratheon.
