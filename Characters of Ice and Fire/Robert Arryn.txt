Robert Arryn, sometimes called Sweetrobin, is the only child of Jon Arryn and Lysa Tully.[3] He is a sickly, whiny child who suffers from frequent seizure-like episodes called a shaking illness. He is depicted as being intellectually and physically stunted. Although he is six, his mother continues to breastfeed him.[48] At the start of the series, he is Lord of the Eyrie and Defender of the Vale and his mother rules as regent in his name.[3] After Lysa's marriage to Petyr Baelish and her subsequent death in a Storm of Swords, Baelish assumes the title Lord Protector of the Vale and claims the rule of the Vale and guardianship of Robert. Robert becomes increasingly emotional and unstable throughout A Feast for Crows and his shaking episodes become more frequent. In the absence of his mother, he becomes highly attached to his cousin Sansa Stark in her disguise of Alayne Stone.[49] In the television adaptation of the novels, the character is renamed Robin Arryn to prevent confusion with Robert Baratheon. He is portrayed by Lino Facioli.[S 1][S 16]

House Lannister is one of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms and the principal house of the Westerlands. Its seat is at Casterly Rock. Its coat of arms displays a golden lion rampant on a crimson field, and its words are Hear Me Roar! More famous than its official motto is the House's unofficial one: A Lannister always pays his debts. The Lannisters ruled as Kings of the Rock until House Targaryen invaded Westeros. They are the richest family in the Seven Kingdoms because of the gold mines located on their lands. They are the main antagonist of the series.
