Arianne Martell is the oldest child and only daughter of Prince Doran Martell of Dorne. She serves as the third-person narrator for two chapters in A Feast for Crows, and she is confirmed to narrate at least two chapters in the upcoming novel The Winds of Winter.[S 6] By Dornish custom, she is the heiress to Sunspear and will inherit the rule of Dorne. Despite her beauty and high birth, she is still unmarried, partially because she found all of the matches her father made insulting. She is calculating, adventurous, and fierce. She is also close with her cousins, the Sand Snakes. By A Storm of Swords, she has been long dissatisfied with her father and his style of rule, believing him to be weak. As Doran's heir, she is allowed to hold titular governance of Dorne while he is away. She plans to name Myrcella Baratheon the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, as by Dornish law Myrcella inherits the title over her brother. Arianne seduces Arys Oakheart to win his support of Myrcella's claim and tells him that Myrcella will allow them to marry although he took a vow renouncing marriage. She knew that crowning Myrcella would start a war and then she could earn vengeance for the death of her uncle Oberyn. The plot is foiled. She confronts her father and tells him that she believes he intended to deny her inheritance. However, he reveals that he secretly betrothed her to Viserys Targaryen as part of a plan to exact vengeance on Tywin Lannister. He made her insulting matches for marriage so that she would not accept them and ruin the plan.
