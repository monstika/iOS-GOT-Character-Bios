Hoster Tully is the Lord of Riverrun and Lord Paramount of the Trident. He is the father of Catelyn Stark, Lysa Arryn, and Edmure Tully. He often quarrels with his brother Brynden because Brynden refuses to be married. Years before the events of the series, he agreed to foster Petyr Baelish at Riverrun as a ward. When he discovered that Lysa was pregnant with Petyr's child, he sent Petyr away and tricked Lysa into drinking an abortifacient potion. Hoster supported Robert Baratheon, House Stark, and House Arryn in rebellion against House Targaryen on the condition that Catelyn and Lysa be wed into the Stark and Arryn families, respectively. At the beginning of A Game of Thrones, he is dying and is bedridden. Because House Lannister threatens the Riverlands, he keeps his illness secret. After Robb Stark rebels and comes to the aid of the Riverlands, Hoster supports him. His condition deteriorates in A Clash of Kings; he has trouble keeping track of time and events. He becomes delirious in A Storm of Swords and can no longer recognize his children. Because of this, Edmure commands Riverrun. In his delirium, he expresses regret over tricking Lysa into aborting her child.[44] He finally passes away and is laid to rest on the river.
