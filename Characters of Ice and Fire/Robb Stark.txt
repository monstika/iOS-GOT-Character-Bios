Robb Stark is the eldest child of Eddard and Catelyn Stark. While he does not have any POV chapters of his own, he is mentioned frequently by the Stark POVs in A Game of Thrones and regularly appears in his mother's POV chapters in the second and third books.

As the first born child of Ned and fifteen years in age, he was already being groomed to take his place as Lord of Winterfell upon his father's death. While he is not his mother's favorite, Catelyn often remarks that she sees a great deal of herself in Robb. He is very close to his half-brother Jon Snow, whom he has never treated like an outsider in the family, and his father's ward Theon Greyjoy, who had been living in Winterfell since they were ten. Robb is sometimes prideful and boyish, but he is also very dignified and shares the same views as his father on duty and honor. Like all his siblings except for his sister Arya and half-brother Jon Snow, he has his mother's red hair, blue eyes, and fair skin (he resembles his father in the TV series).
