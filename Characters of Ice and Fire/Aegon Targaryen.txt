Aegon Targaryen claimed to be the only son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Elia Martell. If Aegon had been crowned, he would have ruled as Aegon VI. Fifteen years before the events of the series, the infant Aegon was reported to have been killed by Gregor Clegane. In A Dance with Dragons, it is claimed that Varys switched Aegon with another infant and smuggled Aegon out of King's Landing. He spent his life in exile and was raised by Jon Connington, a close friend of Rhaegar's. To hide his identity, he dyes his silver hair blue, which also makes his violet eyes appear blue. He also pretends to be the son of Jon, who takes the name Griff, and becomes known as Young Griff. He and Jon plan to conquer Westeros and crown Aegon the King of the Seven Kingdoms. They begin travelling to Volantis to join their strength with his aunt Daenerys Targaryen. When it becomes apparent that Daenerys has no intention of immediately conquering Westeros, the Golden Company abandons their idea of joining her and swear allegiance to Aegon. Aegon decides to attack Westeros while it is embroiled in civil war, partially because it will allow him to meet Daenerys as an equal instead of begging her for aid. The decision was made based on advice given to Aegon by Tyrion Lannister, but it is as yet unknown if Tyrion gave the advice in good faith. The group lands in the Stormlands and capture several castles. Their next target is Storm's End, the ancestral home of House Baratheon. Aegon plans to lead the charge himself and raise the banner of House Targaryen above the battlements.
