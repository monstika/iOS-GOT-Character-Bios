Ser Jorah Mormont is the former Lord of Bear Island in the North, which he inherited after his father Jeor Mormont joined the Night's Watch to pass on the title. After winning a tourney joust, Jorah was allowed to take Lady Lynesse Hightower as his second wife. He went into debt trying to support her lavish lifestyle, and he was sentenced to death after selling poachers to slavers. Rather than join the Night's Watch or die, he and his wife fled to Lys, where she left him to become a concubine of a rich merchant. Jorah became a mercenary and proved himself to be a capable warrior despite his age. He later becomes well-known among the Dothraki people. Though he is not descended from the Andals, the Dothraki dub him Jorah the Andal in reference to his Westerosi origin. Jorah wants nothing more than to return to Bear Island. In A Game of Thrones, he enters into the service of Viserys Targaryen and reports the movements of the exiled prince and his sister Daenerys to Varys, King Robert Baratheon's spymaster. He hopes that he will win a royal pardon and be allowed to return home. He eventually chooses to serve Daenerys over Viserys and becomes one of her most trusted companions. Jorah falls in love with Daenerys and stops assassination attempts caused by his reports. He eventually ends all communication with Varys. After she is widowed, he remains with her and becomes the first knight of her Queensguard.
