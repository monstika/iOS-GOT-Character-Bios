Viserys Targaryen, styling himself Viserys III, is the second born son of Aerys II Targaryen. Thirteen years before the events of the series, he and his sister Daenerys fled Westeros to escape death at the hands of rebel Robert Baratheon. He is a cruel, ambitious, and blunt man who is prone to violent mood swings, maddened by poverty and exile. He spent the past thirteen years wandering through the Free Cities, running from supposed assassins and plotting to return to reclaim his father's throne. He is often mocked as the Beggar King because he must rely on the generosity of those sympathetic to his cause. In A Game of Thrones, he marries his sister to Khal Drogo, hoping that the marriage will buy Drogo's Dothraki warriors. He often states that he is the rightful ruler of the Seven Kingdoms and demands respect, but disrespects Dothraki customs and verbally abuses his sister. He is blind to the fact that virtually everyone, including Daenerys and his sworn knight Jorah Mormont, scorn his petty and vindictive nature. Eventually, Viserys realises that Daenerys is genuinely loved by the Dothraki people, which further infuriates him. When Viserys threatens to kill Daenerys and her unborn child, threatening her with a sword in Vaes Dothrak, where it is forbidden to spill blood, Drogo kills him by "giving him" the golden crown that is part of their agreement, with Viserys held down as molten gold is poured over him. Despite her brother's abuse, knowing that he did keep her safe, Daenerys tries to remember her brother as a good person before his madness and names her cream-colored dragon Viserion after him. Viserys Targaryen is portrayed by Harry Lloyd in the television adaptation of the novels.
