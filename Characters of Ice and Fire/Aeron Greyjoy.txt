Aeron Greyjoy is the youngest of Balon's surviving brothers.[85] He is introduced in A Clash of Kings and serves as a third-person narrator for two chapters of A Feast for Crows. He is also confirmed to narrate at least one chapter in the upcoming novel The Winds of Winter.[S 32] In his youth, he was a ribald drunk and was scorned by Balon. After nearly drowning, he dedicated himself to the Drowned God, the god of his people, and became a high priest.[80] He became a hard, humorless ascetic and lives as a hermit on the beach. He weaves seaweed into his uncut hair, earning him the nickname Damphair. Fellow holy men do his bidding without question, and the people of the Iron Islands greatly respect him.[80] After Balon's death in A Storm of Swords, Euron Greyjoy, Balon and Aeron's brother, returns to claim the throne. However, Euron is not a devout follower of the Drowned God and tradition dictates that the Iron Islands cannot have a godless king. Aeron calls a Kingsmoot in A Feast for Crows to choose Balon's successor. He hoped to crown his brother Victarion, who shares Balon's traditional and conservative ways.[80] However, Euron is crowned. Aeron announces that he will rouse the people against Euron and disappears the next day.
