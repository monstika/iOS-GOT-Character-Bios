Lord Stannis Baratheon is the younger brother of King Robert and older brother of Lord Renly.[3] He is portrayed as a brooding and humorless man with a harsh sense of justice and an obsession with slights both real and imagined. Stannis is known for his stubbornness and determination and is described by Donal Noye as cold iron: "He's cold and brittle and will break before it bends." Nevertheless, he is regarded by many as a capable and skilled naval and military commander.

Stannis is married to Lady Selyse of House Florent, a house sworn to House Tyrell, and has a daughter named Shireen.[3] Fifteen years before the events of the series, Stannis fought alongside his brother when Robert rebelled against House Targaryen, though he was torn between his duty to his family and to the realm and only sided with Robert after much soul searching, and took the Targaryen-controlled fortress Dragonstone after withstanding a lengthy siege of the Baratheon seat, Storm's End, by the armies of House Tyrell. Stannis and his army survived because Davos Seaworth smuggled them enough food to last until the siege was lifted.[65] However, despite Stannis's efforts to win Robert the kingship, Robert didn't thank him for it, instead giving credit elsewhere and blaming Stannis for others' mistakes. To slight Stannis, Robert named Stannis the Lord of Dragonstone while naming Renly the Lord of the wealthier and more powerful Storm's End, which was Stannis's seat by right (though admittedly Stannis was better suited to the task of ruling Dragonstone and the lords sworn to it, who had been staunch Targaryen loyalists). All this occurred before the events of A Game of Thrones. Stannis was also named Master of Ships and later served on Robert's small council after Robert ascended the throne in King's Landing.[3]
