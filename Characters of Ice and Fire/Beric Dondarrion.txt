Beric Dondarrion is the Lord of Blackhaven. He is described as a gallant young lord with great fighting skill. In A Game of Thrones, Eddard Stark sends him to arrest Gregor Clegane and bring peace to the Riverlands. He is ambushed and killed by Lannister forces. His companion Thoros of Myr accidentally revives him with magic during the funeral service. By A Storm of Swords, he and his men have formed an outlaw band called the Brotherhood Without Banners. The Brotherhood starts a guerrilla war against raiders in the Riverlands. The success of these ambushes earns him the nickname the Lightning Lord, also reference to his coat of arms. He is killed and resurrected six times. With each revival, he loses more of his memories and his appearance becomes more corpse-like. In the third book, he and his men find the corpse of Catelyn Stark several days after the Red Wedding. He resurrects her with the last of his life force and dies for the seventh and final time. In the television adaptation of the novels, Beric Dondarrion was portrayed by David Michael Scott in "A Golden Crown" and was portrayed by Richard Dormer for the third season.
