Walder Frey is Lord of the Twins, a castle straddling the Trident River. Called the Lord of the Crossing as the placement of his castle allows him to control who crosses the river, Frey is considered an important ally of strategic importance despite being a vain, ambitious, and untrustworthy man capable of holding grudges. Although he is elderly and suffering from gout, he maintains an active hand in running his House of which he is known for having over a hundred descendants and also equally famous having lived longer than his wives. By the start of the series, he has married his eighth wife. He emphasizes family loyalty and believes in taking care of relations, including those who disappoint him. However, his numerous heirs do not share the sentiment and viciously battle for his favor, some believing that they would turn on each other the moment Walder dies. In addition to his role in the A Song of Ice and Fire series, his four-year-old self makes a short appearance in the Tales of Dunk and Egg novella The Mystery Knight. Although he is a bannerman of House Tully, he does not immediately go to Riverrun when Edmure Tully summons his bannermen to support Robb Stark in A Game of Thrones.

When the Twins became a strategic necessity for Robb, Walder is able to negotiate marriage contracts between his children and grandchildren and Robb and Arya Stark. But Robb married Jeyne Westerling in A Clash of Kings, Frey is outraged and withdraws his support from Robb to conspire with Tywin Lannister and Roose Bolton to enact his revenge. In A Storm of Swords, Walder pretends to make amends with Robb and agrees to marry his daughter Roslin to Edmure. From there, as the wedding dies down, Walder springs the trap and had Robb and his key supporters massacred during the feast, a direct violation of ancient guest right customs. He then openly swears loyalty to House Lannister and his family receives Riverrun, the seat of House Tully, as a reward.
