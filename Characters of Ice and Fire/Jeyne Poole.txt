Jeyne Poole is the daughter of Vayon Poole, the steward of Winterfell, and Sansa Stark's best friend.[19] She has brown eyes and dark hair and is described as being very pretty.[20] Following the arrest of Eddard Stark in A Game of Thrones, the members and servants of his household are killed. She survives and is confined in a room with Sansa. She is later separated from Sansa and put into Petyr Baelish's care.[21] It is later revealed that she is sent to work in a brothel.[S 10] She next appears in A Dance with Dragons where the Lannisters use her as a stand-in for Sansa's younger sister Arya and send her north to marry Ramsay Bolton at Winterfell. However, Theon Greyjoy notices her eyes are not gray like Arya's, and the Boltons are aware of the ruse.[22][23] After the wedding, Ramsay locks her in a tower and horrifically abuses her both physically and sexually.[24] Jon Snow, Arya's half-brother, believes Jeyne to be the real Arya and sends Mance Rayder and his six spearwives to rescue her.[25] The group enlists Theon's help, and Theon and Jeyne barely escape while the castle prepares to defend itself against Stannis Baratheon.[26] The pair are found by a Baratheon bannerman and are brought before Stannis.[27] An excerpt from the upcoming novel The Winds of Winter reveals that Theon and Jeyne continue to tell others that she is Arya because they fear Stannis will send her back to Winterfell if he learns the truth.[S 10] In the HBO adaptation, Jeyne's only appearance so far has been in "Winter is Coming", where she was played by an unidentified extra. She is seen sitting beside Sansa at a feast and is not named in the episode, but it is stated in the DVD commentary that she is Jeyne Poole.
