Olenna Redwyne, also known as the Queen of Thorns, is the mother of Mace Tyrell. She is described as a wizened and cunning old woman with a wicked wit and a sharp tongue, and she is known for openly stating her opinion. In A Storm of Swords, she plans to have Sansa taken to Highgarden to marry her grandson Willas. This plan is foiled when the Lannisters force Sansa to marry Tyrion Lannister. She and Petyr Baelish later poison Joffrey Baratheon at his wedding. Olenna Redwyne is portrayed by Dame Diana Rigg in the third season of the HBO adaptation of the novels.[S 37]

The Night's Watch is a sworn brotherhood of men who patrol the Wall, a massive wall of ice in the North, and defend the Seven Kingdoms against threats from beyond the Wall, usually wildling raiders. As the series progresses, the true enemies are established to be a mysterious and supernatural race called the Others and wights, the reanimated bodies of their victims.[95][96] The Brothers of the Watch vow to never hold land and titles, never take a wife, never father children, cut ties to their families, take no part in the quarrels of the kingdom, and "live and die at [their] post."[97][98] Breaking these vows or desertion is punishable by death.[99] They wear only black, so joining the Watch is known as "taking the black."[95][100] The type of men who join the Watch has been shown to vary. Even the first scene of Game of Thrones shows a team of rangers led by a younger son of a noble family and two men of common birth. Many of the men in the Night's Watch are criminals, and serving in the Night's Watch is seen as a way of allowing them to redeem themselves. For example, rapists are allowed to choose between castration and joining the Watch, Jorah Mormont was exiled from Westeros for selling his poachers to slavers rather than sending them to the Wall, and when Eddard Stark is convinced to confess to treason, he is told that he will be allowed to join the Night's Watch. Joining the Watch is still considered an honor in some circles because any man can rise through the ranks regardless of illegitimacy or criminal past, but by the events of A Game of Thrones, it is a shadow of its former self.[101][100] It has become a pitiful force.[102] There are not enough men to staff all of the nineteen castles along the Wall, so sixteen are abandoned and in ruins at the start of the series. Only Castle Black, Shadow Tower, and Eastwatch-by-the-Sea remain in use.[103][104] In A Dance with Dragons, Lord Commander Jon Snow has resolved to repair and staff every castle by any means necessary before the year is out.[105][106] The Watch is based out of Castle Black, where the Lord Commander of the Watch resides and new recruits are trained.[103] At the end of training, new recruits are assigned jobs: builders are craftsmen who repair the castles and smith weapons, stewards take care of administration, housekeeping and other day-to-day tasks, and rangers are the primary fighting force and are sent on patrols.[107][108]
