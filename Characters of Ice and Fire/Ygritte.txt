Ygritte is a wildling woman. She is fierce and headstrong. In wildling culture she is known as a spearwife, a woman who is also a warrior. Because her hair is red, the wildlings believe her to be "kissed by fire" and consider her lucky. Wildlings practice marriage by capture, so she is considered Jon's wife because he takes her captive upon their first meeting in A Clash of Kings. Jon initially refuses her advances throughout A Storm of Swords, but the two soon begin a sexual relationship. Jon is torn between his love for her and his duty to the Night's Watch and the realm, but ultimately, he chooses to honour his vows and abandons the wildlings to report back on their movements; Ygritte nearly kills him when he flees. Ygritte joins the wildling attack on Castle Black and is killed in the battle's closing moments, taking an arrow in the heart. Jon finds her among the dead and the dying, and Ygritte dies in his arms. Her death continues to haunt Jon. Ygritte was fond of saying "You know nothing, Jon Snow." She is portrayed by Rose Leslie in the HBO adaptation of the novels.[S 40]

Val is the sister of Mance Rayder's wife, Dalla. After the failed Wildling incursion, she is kept prisoner at the wall. Stannis and his men refer to her as the "wildling princess," and there is talk of having her make a political marriage, despite Jon's attempts to explain that Wildlings do not have the same hereditary nobility customs as other inhabitants of Westeros. She is described as exceptionally attractive by Jon. In A Dance with Dragons, Jon Snow sends her alone on a mission to bring a Wildling warlord named Tormund Giantsbane and his people to the Wall. She rides alone into the wilderness and returns weeks later with Tormund, the mission successful.
